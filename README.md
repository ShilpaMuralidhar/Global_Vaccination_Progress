# Project 2: World Immunization Progress

![Muracan](images/rice-cookers-project2.jpg)


## Team members: Shilpa Muralidhar, Lisa Cannon, Brian Labelle, 
# Technical Consultant: Matt Hawley

## Data:
Unicef Immunization percentages by country over the recent 40 years. Data on 15 vaccines. Sanitation, hygiene, and water supply measures.

## Goal:
The goal of this project is to collect, visualize, and analyze the percent to people vaccinated in each country worldwide. We want to answer 1. how percent immunized changed over, 2. how percent immunized is distributed worldwide, and 3. Does there exist a relationship between percent immunized and life expectancy or infant mortality.

## Inspiration:
Our inspiration for choosing this topic is Shilpaâ€™s background in immunization research and her ongoing passion for learning more about the influence of immunization to world health. Some visualization inspiration we found include:
https://unicef.shinyapps.io/wuenic_analytics/ and https://data.humdata.org/organization/unicef-data
