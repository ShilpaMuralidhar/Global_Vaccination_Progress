# Project 2: World Immunization Progress

![PewlettHackard](images/rice-cookers-project2.jpg)


## Proposal | World Immunization Progress

# Team members: Lisa Cannon, Brian Labelle, Shilpa Muralidhar
# Technical Consultant: Matt Hawley

## Data:
Unicef Immunization percentages by country over the recent 40 years. Data on 15 vaccines. Sanitation, hygiene, and water supply measures.

## Goal:
The goal of this project is to collect, visualize, and analyze the percent to people vaccinated in each country worldwide. We want to answer 1. how percent immunized changed over, 2. how percent immunized is distributed worldwide, and 3. Does there exist a relationship between percent immunized and life expectancy or infant mortality.

## Inspiration:
Our inspiration for choosing this topic is Shilpa’s background in immunization research and her ongoing passion for learning more about the influence of immunization to world health. Some visualization inspiration we found include:
https://unicef.shinyapps.io/wuenic_analytics/ and https://data.humdata.org/organization/unicef-data

**Create SQL tables to house the required CSV files.**
It’s important to note that the sequence of creating the SQL tables is critical in order to properly implement the usage of primary keys & foreign keys constraints during the table creation phase. While it’s possible to alter the tables, it’s always best to map out the proper table creation sequence prior to starting. Creating the ER diagram helps with identifying the proper sequence. You must create the main data tables first that have no foreign key constraints, so Employees & Departments table are created first. The auxiliary supporting tables or passthrough join tables can only be created after as they contain foreign keys which point to the primary data tables. 

It’s also important to note that using a **standard naming convention with an underscore** shows that these tables are used as passthrough join tables. dept_emp table naming implies that this is a join table between the departments table and the employees table with implies 1 department name to many employees. As opposed to a single named table as in employees which only contains employees.

1. Create the Employees table with the emp_no as the primary key.
2. Create the departments table with the dept_no as primary key.
3. Creating the salaries & titles tables, they do not have any primary keys but they do have foreign keys back into the employees table.
4. Creating the dept_manager & dept_emp tables have 2 foreign keys which reference the employees table and the departments table.
5. When possible, default values were set based on possible future data entries if project is deemed usable. A default hiredate in the employee table was set to CURRENTDATE. Many other date fields called to_date were set with a default value of 9999-01-01 as a date in the future.

6. Next step is to import the CSV files into the tables.
      - [x] import employees.csv 
      - [x] import salaries.csv
      - [x] import titles.csv
      - [x] import departments.csv
      - [x] import dept_emp.csv
      - [x] import dept_manager.csv
      - [x] import employees.csv


# 3. Data Analysis

Once we have completed the imports, we need to address the following:


**1. List the following details of each employee: 
employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.**

            select e.emp_no, e.last_name, e.first_name, e.gender, s.salary from employees e
            left join salaries s on s.emp_no = e.emp_no 
            order by emp_no

 # **BONUS**
As you examine the data, you are overcome with a creeping suspicion that the dataset is fake. You surmise that your boss handed you spurious data in order to test the data engineering skills of a new employee. To confirm your hunch, you decide to take the following steps to generate a visualization of the data, with which you will confront your boss:

1. Import the SQL database into Pandas.

![Data-Analysis-Pandas-DataFrame](images/ph-dataframe-avg-salary-by-title.jpg)


## **Create a bar chart of average salary by title.**

      # plot dataframe for the average salary as a bar chart with the appropriate labels.
      df_salaries2.plot.bar()
      ax = df_salaries2['Average Salary'].plot(kind='bar', title ="Pewlett Hackard | Average Salary by Title", figsize=(15, 10), legend=False, fontsize=12)
      plt.xlabel("Pewlett Hackard | Title")
      plt.ylabel("Pewlett Hackard | Average Salary")

      plt.show()

![Data-Analysis-Bar-Chart](images/ph-notebook-avg-salary-by-title.jpg)


_________________________________________________________________________________

 # **EPILOGUE**
Evidence in hand, you march into your boss's office and present the visualization. With a sly grin, your boss thanks you for your work. On your way out of the office, you hear the words, "Search your ID number." You look down at your badge to see that your employee ID number is 499942.

**Employee Number : 499942.**

            select * from employees where emp_no = '499942'
